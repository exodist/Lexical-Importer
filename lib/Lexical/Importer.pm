=head1 NAME

Lexical::Importer - Importer + Lexical subs/vars.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of L<Importer> which will import all symbols as lexicals
instead of package symbols.

=head1 IMPORTANT NOTE

This imports symbols into the currently compiling scope which is not
necessarily the same as the package doing the importing.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Say you have a module, C<Foo.pm>:

    package Foo

    use base 'Exporter';
    our @EXPORT = qw/foo/;

    sub foo { 'foo' }

You want to import C<foo()> to use, but you also have your own C<foo()> method
you do not want to squash in C<Your::Module.pm>

    # Define package versions first
    sub foo { 'not lexical' }

    say foo(); # prints 'not lexical';

    {
        use Lexical::Importer Foo => 'foo';
        say foo(); # prints 'foo'
    }

    say foo(); # prints 'not lexical' again;

    use Lexical::Importer Foo => 'foo';
    say foo(); # prints 'foo'

    say __PACKAGE__->foo(); # prints 'not lexical', method dispatch find package sub.

    # Remove lexical subs
    no Lexical::Importer;
    say foo(); # prints 'not lexical' again;

=head1 IMPORTER

This package inherits from L<Importer> and works exactly the same apart from
being lexical instead of modifying the symbol table.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Importer> - The importer module this package subclasses

L<Lexical::Var> and L<Lexical::Sub> - The awesome modules Zefram wrote that
make this possible. I<Note: Lexical::Importer ships with a forked copy of these>

L<Lexical::Import> - A similar module, but it does not support everything
L<Lexical::Importer> does.

=head1 LEXICAL-VAR FORK

The L<Lexical::Importer> module is bundled with a fork of the L<Lexical::Var> XS
code. This fork is necessary due to L<Lexical::Var> being broken on newer
perls. The author of the original package is not accepting third party patches,
and has not yet fixed the issues himself. Once a version of L<Lexical::Var>
ships with a fix for newer perls this fork will likely be removed.
