NAME

    Lexical::Importer - Importer + Lexical subs/vars.

DESCRIPTION

    This is a subclass of Importer which will import all symbols as
    lexicals instead of package symbols.

IMPORTANT NOTE

    This imports symbols into the currently compiling scope which is not
    necessarily the same as the package doing the importing.

SYNOPSIS

    Say you have a module, Foo.pm:

        package Foo
    
        use base 'Exporter';
        our @EXPORT = qw/foo/;
    
        sub foo { 'not lexical' }

    You want to import foo() to use, but you also have your own foo()
    method you do not want to squash in Your::Module.pm

        # Define package versions first
        sub foo { 'not lexical' }
    
        say foo(); # prints 'not lexical';
    
        {
            use Lexical::Importer Foo => 'foo';
            say foo(); # prints 'foo'
        }
    
        say foo(); # prints 'not lexical' again;
    
        use Lexical::Importer Foo => 'foo';
        say foo(); # prints 'foo'
    
        say __PACKAGE__->foo(); # prints 'not lexical', method dispatch find package sub.
    
        # Remove lexical subs
        no Lexical::Importer;
        say foo(); # prints 'not lexical' again;

IMPORTER

    This package inherits from Importer and works exactly the same apart
    from being lexical instead of modifying the symbol table.

SEE ALSO

    Importer - The importer module this package subclasses

    Lexical::Var and Lexical::Sub - The awesome modules Zefram wrote that
    make this possible. Note: Lexical::Importer ships with a forked copy of
    these

    Lexical::Import - A similar module, but it does not support everything
    Lexical::Importer does.

LEXICAL-VAR FORK

    The Lexical::Importer module is bundled with a fork of the Lexical::Var
    XS code. This fork is necessary due to Lexical::Var being broken on
    newer perls. The author of the original package is not accepting third
    party patches, and has not yet fixed the issues himself. Once a version
    of Lexical::Var ships with a fix for newer perls this fork will likely
    be removed.
